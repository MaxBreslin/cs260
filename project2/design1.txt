Song ADT:
1. The Song ADT will have getters and setters for each of its member functions. It will also have comparison
operators for comparing the number of likes or the title and artist.
2. The getter functions will return the value of the member variable on success. For getting artist and title,
the function may fail to allocate memory for the string. In this case, the function will throw an exception.
The setter functions will throw an exception if the passed value is not valid. Comparison operators will
return true if the condition is met and false otherwise.
3. The member variables are private so that they cannot be accessed directly. The setters and constructors
make sure that only valid values are assigned to the member variables.
4. m_artist and m_title will store pointers to dynamically allocated arrays.
